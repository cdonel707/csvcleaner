I work primarily on backend systems, but feel very confident with frontend development, UX and UI design. 

I’m responsible for full software development cycle, from writing code and tests to building deployment pipelines. I believe in “you build it - you ship it”.

I constantly learn and try new things, technologies and frameworks. It sometimes involves building tens of prototypes for work or hobby projects. 

I like to share what I learn or build with others, so I often perform talks and workshops with-in company, or externally on meetups or conferences. I’m proactive member of software development community and one of the organizers of Golang community in Barcelona.
